This package contains the Bluetooth Application LIBBSA Client library on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth LIBBSA Client library you have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_project_example/my_project/libbsa/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For MIPS/Linux target

The libbsa.txt file (which controls the BSA modules present in the library) may
have to be adapted to your system (to add missing modules or to reduce code size).

Both Shared and Static libraries are created (for both x86 and mips platforms).

Furthermore, all the include file needed by the application are copied (during
build) in the libbsa/include folder.

Thanks to the bsalib library, the applications does not have to compile anymore
the BSA client (just to link with its library).
Furthermore, for application, only libbsa/include include folder has to be used.
