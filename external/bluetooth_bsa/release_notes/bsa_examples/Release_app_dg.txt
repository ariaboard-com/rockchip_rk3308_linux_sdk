This package contains the Bluetooth DG (app_dg) on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth DG application you have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/std/linux/app_dg/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For MIPS/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_dg/build/x86/app_dg

Both bsa server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For mips based embeded target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the target platform (from the same location used to execute the bt_server).
