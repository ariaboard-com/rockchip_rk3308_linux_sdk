This package contains the Bluetooth Application Mono Headset (app_hs) on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth Headset application you have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_examples/linux/app_hs/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For MIPS/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_hs/build/x86/app_hs

In fact both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For MIPS target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the MIPS platform (from the same location used to execute the bt_server).

Ensure that the application side has been built with the following setting in app_hs.txt
	BSA_HS_INCLUDED = TRUE
Ensure that the server side has been built with the following setting in bte_server.txt
	BTA_HS_INCLUDED = TRUE
