This package contains the Bluetooth Application Test Module application (app_tm) on Linux.

To compile the Bluetooth TM  server application you have to type:
> cd 3rdparty/embedded/bsa_examples/linux/app_tm/build
> make			<= For PC/Linux target (default)
> make CPU=mips		<= For MIPS/Linux target

For PC/Linux target, the application executable is located in build/x86 folder.
To execute it, you have to go in the folder used to start the server application:
> cd  ../../server/build/
> ../../app_tm/build/x86/app_tm

In fact both server and applications need to access the named socket file (bt-daemon-socket),
which is created when the server is started.

For MIPS target, the application executable is located in build/mips folder.
To execute it, you have to copy and to execute it on the MIPS platform (from the same location used to execute the bt_server).

This makefile compiles the app_tm.c file and links the object with the libbsa.a, static, library.
This means that the libbsa.a library must be compiled with TM included (BSA_TM_INCLUDED = TRUE)
